# project-template

DotNetCore 2.1 Framework<br/>
The goal of this project is to give the developer a jumping-off place to start a new project that should not only fast-forward the first couple of days of development, but also be conducive to a healthy long-term project organization. <br/>
<br/>
This project is not centered around a delivery methodology. You could use this template to create a windows service, a website or anything in between.
